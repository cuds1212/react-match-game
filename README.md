# REACT-MATCH-GAME

## Description
This is a matching game created with React and bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. Media queries are used for basic responsiveness. A live version of the app is located [here](https://obscure-beyond-51594.herokuapp.com/).

## Notes
The `index.js` file is setup to serve the app as a static site using Express. Use `npm start_dev` for local development. A `heroku-postbuild` script has been added to allow Heroku to build a production version of the app.
